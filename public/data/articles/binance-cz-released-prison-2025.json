      "content": "In his first post-prison tweet, CZ revealed plans to launch a privacy-focused DeFi exchange that will operate with zero KYC requirements and complete user sovereignty. The project aims to bring the speed and low costs of centralized exchanges to the decentralized world while maintaining absolute user control over funds. CZ emphasized that the lessons learned from Binance's regulatory challenges would inform the new platform's design from day one. The announcement sent DeFi tokens like UNI and AAVE up 15-20% as investors positioned for what could become the next big thing in crypto infrastructure."
