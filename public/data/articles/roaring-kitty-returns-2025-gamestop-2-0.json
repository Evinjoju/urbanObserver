      "content": "Keith Gill, known as Roaring Kitty, has sent shockwaves through Wall Street with his first social media post in three years — a simple cat picture that triggered an immediate 400% surge in GameStop stock. Trading volume exploded to levels not seen since the 2021 short squeeze, with retail investors piling in once again. The stock, which had been trading under $20 for most of 2025, rocketed past $100 in after-hours trading as the crypto and meme stock communities mobilized."

      "content": "Gill's return comes as GameStop completed its transformation into a tech company with $4 billion in cash and zero debt. The company has been quietly building a Bitcoin treasury and developing blockchain gaming initiatives. The sudden price action caught major hedge funds flat-footed, with short interest still at 18% despite the run-up. Trading was halted six times on volume exceeding 2 billion shares — the highest single-day volume in history."

Ryan Cohen's vision of transforming GameStop into a technology platform appears to be gaining traction. The return of Roaring Kitty has reignited the retail investor revolution, proving that social media influence remains a powerful market force."
