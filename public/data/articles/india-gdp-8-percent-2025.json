      "content": "India has officially become the world's fastest-growing major economy for the third consecutive year, posting 8.2% GDP growth in 2025. The IMF has upgraded its forecast to 8% for 2025-26, positioning India to surpass Japan as the third-largest economy by 2027. Services exports, manufacturing boom, and massive infrastructure spending have created a virtuous cycle of growth that shows no signs of slowing."

The 'Make in India' initiative has attracted $200 billion in foreign direct investment for manufacturing, with Apple, Samsung, and Tesla all building major facilities.

      "content": "India's young population and growing middle class are driving consumption at levels unseen in other major economies. Domestic demand now accounts for 70% of growth, reducing vulnerability to global shocks. The government's infrastructure push — $1.5 trillion planned over five years — has created millions of jobs and improved logistics dramatically. The combination of digital infrastructure, manufacturing growth, and consumption boom has created what economists are calling 'the most favorable macroeconomic environment in decades.'"
